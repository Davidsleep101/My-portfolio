**Key Changes I Made:**

* **HTML Structure:** The overall HTML structure remains the same, but the content within the sections is now personalized.
* **Hero Section:** Updated with your name and summary.
* **Projects Grid:**
    * The `RTX25_0384.jpg` image is now linked correctly for the Raytheon project.
    * I've added several more project cards based on your resume, including:
        * ESP32 Drone Project
        * ACM Hackathon Competition
        * NASA Space Exploration Software Simulation
        * District Robotics Competition
        * Engineering & Robotics Project
    * **Important:** For the *new* project cards, I've used generic placeholder image names like `placeholder_drone.jpg`, `placeholder_hackathon.jpg`, etc. **You will need to create and add actual images for these projects to your `images/` folder and update the `src` attributes accordingly.**
    * I've included a `Learn More` link for each, which you'll eventually update to point to individual project detail pages (e.g., `projects/raytheon.html`).
* **About Me Section:** Populated with your summary and a refined list of your skills, pulling directly from your resume. I also included a link to your resume PDF.
    * **Action:** Make sure `David Falekulo PDF Resume.pdf` is in the **root directory** of your project (the same level as `index.html`) for the link to work.
* **Contact Section:** Updated with your email and LinkedIn profile URL from your resume. I assumed your GitHub username is `davidsleep101` based on your portfolio URL; please correct this if it's different.
* **Footer:** Updated with your name.

**Next Steps for You:**

1.  **Replace `index.html`:** Copy and paste the entire code block above into your `index.html` file, overwriting its current content.
2.  **Add Images for Projects:** Create or find images for your other projects (ESP32 Drone, Hackathon, NASA, Robotics, Engineering). Save them as `placeholder_drone.jpg`, `placeholder_hackathon.jpg`, `placeholder_nasa.jpg`, `placeholder_robotics.jpg`, `placeholder_engineering.jpg` (or whatever names you prefer, just make sure the `src` in the HTML matches) inside your `images/` folder.
3.  **Place Resume PDF:** Ensure your `David Falekulo PDF Resume.pdf` file is in the root directory of your project (where `index.html` is).
4.  **Save all files** (`index.html` and any new images).
5.  **Open `index.html` in your browser** to see your updated portfolio.

This will give you a much more complete and personalized website!
